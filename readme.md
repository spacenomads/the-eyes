# The Eyes - Logo fan art

I love Javi de Castro's webcomic series [The Eyes](https://www.javidecastro.com/theeyes), and every time I visit the site, I think it would be great that the eye moves following the cursor.

So I made one fan art that makes just that!

You can see it live at [https://spacenomads.github.io/the-eyes/](https://spacenomads.github.io/the-eyes/)
